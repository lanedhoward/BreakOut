LANE BREAKOUT DOCUMENTATION

Goals:
	-Proper collisions with the sides of blocks
		-done!
		-some mild imperfections when it comes to multiple block collisions at once, but i think it is fine for now
	-Combo multiplier for hitting multiple blocks with just one paddle hit
		-done!
		-combo scales exponentially to really reward combos
	-High control / high level of influence over paddle bounces
		-done!
		-influence ball x dir based on where on the paddle you hit
	-Double tap to dash the paddle in a direction
		-going to bind to a dedicated dash button. since sometimes double taps are needed for precise movements
		-dash is more like a short teleport. same effect.

other notes:
	-Made a few methods such as scoremanager.setupnewgame() and Ball.resetBall() public so the game can use it.
		-could have made a GameManager class but it is close to the deadline so i just put logic in the Game1 class
	-autopaddle is toggleable by pressing A
