LANE BREAKOUT DOCUMENTATION

Goals:
	-Proper collisions with the sides of blocks
		-done!
		-some mild imperfections when it comes to multiple block collisions at once, but i think it is fine for now
	-Combo multiplier for hitting multiple blocks with just one paddle hit
		-done!
		-combo scales exponentially to really reward combos
	-High control / high level of influence over paddle bounces
		-done!
		-influence ball x dir based on where on the paddle you hit
	-Double tap to dash the paddle in a direction
		-going to bind to a dedicated dash button. since sometimes double taps are needed for precise movements
		-dash is more like a short teleport. same effect.

other notes:
	-Made a few methods such as scoremanager.setupnewgame() and Ball.resetBall() public so the game can use it.
		-could have made a GameManager class but it is close to the deadline so i just put logic in the Game1 class
	-autopaddle is toggleable by pressing A

Modification Description : what you changed and why its better/funner
	-see above
Structural Changes : what new classes did you add what classes did you modify. Why did you decide to make these changes where you did?
	-see above
State Changes : Did you need to refactor any state to accommodate your changes? What did you refactor and why?
	- game now has state to account for title screens and summary screens.
Maintainability : Did you improve the baseline of the source code to make it more sustainable or did you accrue technical debt?
	- some minor improvements and some minor accrual of technical debt. would not be too difficult to fix the technical debt though.
