breakout documentation

most of it is the same as my monogame.

had to add a GameState, just put that in scoremanager since it was already static.
but it should probably go elsewhere.

made the paddle bounce via halves instead of thirds. idk if this is better or not.

still can dash with spacebar.

have to press Up to respawn the ball, and then Up again to shoot it.

a lot of logic abouot restarting the game went into the BallController class, which
i think is wrong. I think Input stuff should go with the paddle since the paddle is the player character.
